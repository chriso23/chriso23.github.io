Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written
in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a
static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs
to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

## Instructions

1. Install a full [Ruby development environment](/docs/installation/)

2. Install Jekyll and [bundler](/docs/ruby-101/#bundler) [gems](/docs/ruby-101/#gems)
```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

3. Create a new Jekyll site at `./blog`
```
jekyll new blog
```

4. Go to your siteâ€™s directory
```
cd blog
```

5. Build the site and make it available on a local server
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

6. Now browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000){:target="_blank"}
